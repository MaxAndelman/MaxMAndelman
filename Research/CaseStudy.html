    <p>This is an interactive video series created by 3Blue1Brown that introduces the concept of quaternions.</p>
    <p>
        It shows how unit quaternions, ones with distance one from the origin, can be projected into the enterity of 3D space.
        The series builds up the intution for this by showing how a circle can be projected to a line and a sphere into a plane.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this understanding, the series shows what it means to multiply quaternions and uses that to explain why qpq<sup>-1</sup>,
        where q:=cos(θ/2)+sin(θ/2)(ai+bj+ck)<br>and q<sup>-1</sup>:=cos(-θ/2)+sin(-θ/2)(ai+bj+ck), rotates p by θ.
    </p>
    <p>
        An interactive vieo series is a great way to teach a topic like this to the general public.
        People can spend as much or as little time as they want playing with numbers to fully understand the topic.
        It also allows the videos to not waste as much time explaining the topic in as much depth because people can spend time figuring out details on their own.
        This does require the audience to be intrested in the topic and want to fully understand it. Otherwise, a traditional video is probably better.
