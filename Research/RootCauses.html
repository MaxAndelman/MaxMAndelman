    <h1>Root Causes</h1>
    <p>Note: My project doen't have a clear "cause," so I'm explaining a therom using quaternions.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723086907000151">Source: A note on the fundamental theorem of algebra for the octonions</a></h4>
    <p>This explains how the Fundamental Therom of Algebra (all polynomials P(z):=a<sub>1</sub>z<sup>n</sup>+a<sub>2</sub>z<sup>n-1</sup>+...+a<sub>n-1</sub>z+a<sub>n</sub> has a zero in C [the complex numbers]) expands to quaternions and octonions.</p>
    <p>Because quaternions and octonions aren't communitive (ABâ‰ BA), polynomials for octonions are defined as P(o):=a<sub>0</sub>oa<sub>1</sub>o...a<sub>n</sub>o+(lower terms), and the a<sub>m</sub> constants are quaternions.
    <p>The therom is proved with lemmas (proofs used in a proof of a larger therom) showing these polynomials are continuous and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy">homotopic (there a continuous function between any polynomials)</a>, and another lemma that I dont understand (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_continuous_mapping">Lemma 4: "The map  has degree p<sub>n</sub> in the sense of Brouwer."</a>).</p>
    <p>The proof uses contridition to assume that a polynomial maps from K to K\{0} (has a domain in the algebra over the octonions and has a range in the algebra without the point "0") and shows how this forms a contridiction with Lemma 4.</p>
    <p>
        Some properties, like the commmunitive property, don't hold in higher dimensions. Although the Fundimantal Therom of Algebra does have to be changed slightly, it does generally hold.
        Likeley at some dimension, something will break that will cause it to no longer be true, but even through octonions, many of the most important theroms hold.
